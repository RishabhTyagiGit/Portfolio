            Curious about me? Here you have it:
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            I&apos;m a passionate web developer who specializes in building
            high-performance and secure web applications. I thrive on crafting
            seamless digital experiences, ensuring that every application I
            build is optimized, secure, and user-friendly. Performance,
            scalability, and maintainability are at the core of my development
            approach.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            I started my web development journey 7 years ago, working across
            startups and enterprises like Netflix, where I built and optimized
            large-scale applications. Over the years, I&apos;ve continually
            evolved, taking on new challenges and mastering modern web
            technologies such as React, Next.js, NextAuth, ImageKit (for DAM),
            Contentful (for CMS), Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            I enjoy working on products end to end, from ideation to
            development, and I always strive to follow gold-standard web
            security practices to ensure applications are robust and reliable.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            When I&apos;m not in full-on developer mode, you can find me
            exploring new technologies, engaging with the dev community, or
            catching up on the latest trends in startups and web security. You
            can connect with me on GitHub or LinkedIn to see what I&apos;m
            working on.
